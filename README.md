# Customers API

A project to create customers and their Orders API endpoints.

## Project Goals

4. Implement authentication and authorization via OpenID Connect
5. When an order is added, send the customer an SMS alerting them (you can use the
Africaâ€™s Talking SMS gateway and sandbox)
6. Write unit tests (with coverage checking) and set up CI + automated CD. You can deploy
to any PAAS/FAAS/IAAS of your choice
7. Write a README for the project and host it on your GitHub
